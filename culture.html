                    <h2>This is masinqo</h2>
                    <p>A late twentieth century single stringed horsehair fiddle and bow of the type known as a Masenqo from Ethiopia. The goat skin covered lozenge shaped soundbox is bisected by a wooden neck and peg and a single horse hair string. It is tuned by means of a large tuning peg at the top of the neck. The instrument is used by Ethiopian minstrels, or azmaris ("singer" in Amharic) and requires considerable virtuosity.</p>

                    <h2>This is Kebero</h2>
                    <p>A Kebero (Amharic: ከበሮ) is a double-headed, conicdal hand drum used in the traditional music of Eritrea, Sudan and Ethiopia. A piece of animal hide is stretched over each end of the instrument, thus forming a membranophone. A large version of the kebero is also used in Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox Christian liturgical music, while smaller versions are used in secular celebrations.</p>

                     <h2>This is Kerar</h2>
                     <p>Krar is a five-or-six stringed bowl-shaped lyre from Ethiopia and Eritrea. It is tuned to a pentatonic scale. A modern Krar may be amplified, much in the same way as an electric guitar or violin. The Krar, along with Masenqo and the Washint, is one of the most widespread musical instruments of the Amhara ethnic group</p>
